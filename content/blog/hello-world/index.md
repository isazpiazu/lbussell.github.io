## Welcome to my blog!

This is my first post on my new blog! How exciting!

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.

To fill some space, here's some information about my favorite keyboard:

> The Planck is a DIY compact 40% ortholinear (as opposed to staggered) keyboard kit that optimises the use of your hands in a thumb-oriented layout. The 2u spacebar layout features a 2u spacebar (stabiliser is optional at this size) with a total of 47 keys. The Grid layout features 2 1u keys in place of the 2u for a full 48 key grid.
